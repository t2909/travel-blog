                <h2> “LIFE IS EITHER A DARING ADVENTURE OR NOTHING AT ALL” ~ HELEN KELLER</h2>
                <p>When we travel, we love immersing in the culture of a destination and there is no better way than to join a celebration  or festival and we rediscover ourselves too. 
                    But after this crazy year of 2020, I wonder if these amazing and huge festivals around the world will ever be the same?Will thousands of people gather again to celebrate life, music, culture and religion? 
                    We certainly hope so.
                    India is a country, where u can find all different kind of views(mountains beaches sanctuaries lakes forts)that travellers love 
                    to visit and discover and food and cultures too that makes it  so amazing to enjoy every inch of it and here you will get to know
                    about  6 different states and its history, culture and the best places to visit and definitely food for food lovers who love to discover
                    new tastes.
